# intelmodal

This project was generated with the [Angular Full-Stack Generator](https://github.com/DaftMonk/generator-angular-fullstack) version 4.1.2.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [Node.js and npm](nodejs.org) Node >= 6.9.x, npm >= 3.10.x,
- Generator-angular-fullstack) version 4.1.2.
- [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) (`npm install --global gulp`)
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.org/) - Keep a running daemon with `mongod`
- Please use Yeoman 1.8.x to create routes, endpoints or others to keep the code structure.

### Developing

1. Run `npm install` to install server dependencies.

2. Run `mongod` in a separate shell to keep an instance of the MongoDB Daemon running

3. Run `gulp serve` to start the development server. It should automatically open the client in your browser when ready.

## Build & development

Run `gulp build` for building and `gulp serve` for preview.

## Testing

Running `npm test` will run the unit tests with karma.

## Design and Development

1. Mock Up/Placeholder routes have been created for illustration purpose.

2. The frontend development will be checked in the "frontend" branch

3. Requirements are embedded in the HTML page, and sample data is in the controllers/component

4. Write well documented code

5. Write good unit tests.

6. The priority for the design is usability, mistake forgiving, since the target user groups are generally of low education.

7. Check in completed code as frequent as possible, and prepared to change based on the feedback.
