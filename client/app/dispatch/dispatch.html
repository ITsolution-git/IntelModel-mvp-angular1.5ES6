    	Relationship (Jobs --1:N --> Containers --> 1: N trips)

    	Bundled trips for a trucking company: 1 set of trips from jobs.

    	All jobs with the quotes being accepted by customers

    	A tree table of Job --> its containers --> trips for each containers

    	Dispatcher can add/edit/remove/change ordering a trip to a container

    	The information for a trip is the following:
    	   From: one of the options: JOB Level's FROM, JOB LEVEL's TO, type-in
    	   To: one of the options: JOB Level's FROM, JOB LEVEL's TO, type-in
    	   Constraints: Before: Date or null, After: Date or null, On: Date or null

    	Once all trips have been created by dispatcher

    	They click on "Schedule" to start the automatic trip bundling and assign them to trucking companies
    	After Scheduling is completed, each bundled trips should have at least a trucking company assigned.

    	The scheduling algorithm (to be developed) will bundle a set of trips (could be from different containers 
    	or even from different jobs) 
    	to one or more trucking companies (each company will have to bid on the set later).

    	Dispatcher can view the assignments in two views 

    	[1] by trucking company assignment

    	A tree table of Trucking Company --> its bundled trips --> associated container --> job

    	[2] by the bundled trips

    	A tree view of Bundled trips --> Trucking companies --> Their bid

    	Dispatcher can select a trucking company for a bundled trip after reviewing their bid.

    	Once a trucking company is selected, it becomes a Dispatched Job ( a set of bundled trips).

    	Trucking company will see the bundled trips in their trucking assignment view.
